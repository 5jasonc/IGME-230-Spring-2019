## VIII. Demo/Exercise (Needs work.  Was from Frameworks and Libraries lecture)

Now we will build a responsive web page using the [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com) framework. This will be a simplified version of the page created in the Skeleton Tutorial linked above.
1. First we will look at the completed version of the demo (and the Skeleton Tutorial) in class. The Skeleton Tutorial has some nice features such as LightBox that you will likely want to use on your project.
1. Next we will download the start files from mycourses (we will use the image files from the Skeleton Tutorial above)
1. Now head to http://getskeleton.com, look over the docs and download the skeleton framework
1. Copy the *css* folder from the Skeleton download into our *start* folder
1. Link to *css/normalize.css* & *css/skeleton.css*
1. Head to https://fonts.google.com and copy the link to the *Abel* and *Satisfy* fonts
1. Walk through *skeleton.css*:
    - change max-width of container to 1000
    - skeleton uses a 12-column layout
    - *container* class
    - *columns* class
    - *row* class
1. Build container &lt;div>
1. Add &lt;header>
1. Use CSS to style up the header. We will make it 12 columns wide (the full 1000px width) and give it a green background color.
1. Add rows, columns, and images - wow those images are big!
1. Add CSS to fix things.
1. Resize the window to see how the framework is automatically responsive.
1. Make even more responsive with media queries
1. When you're done, make sure this gets zipped up and submitted to the myCourses dropbox.
