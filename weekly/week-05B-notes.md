# Week 5B: Grid-based Web Layouts, Intro to PHP

## Today's topics:
- Finish Group Exercise.  Present octolist websites.
- Briefly discuss the grid systems in CSS frameworks.
- Demo:  CSS Grid + Flexbox demo.  Start Files are in myCourses.  (note, it's the same zip from week 3... this time we get to the gridlayout.html part)
- If time, Introduction to PHP.

## Homework:
- Begin looking at [PHP materials](week-06-notes.md) in advance.
- Watch dropboxes carefully.  There will be quite a few PHP drop-boxes.

## Project 1 reminders:
- You should have some good ideas about your game by now and you should have written your content in a text file. 
- You should be getting your content into markdown format and posting it to your GitHub repository.
- You should have sketched a likely design for your Project 1 website.
  - Think about responsiveness early.  What will your site look like on mobile?
- You are likely to have begun to build the site.
