## <a id="week1">Week 1 : Course Intro & FTP/banjo/.htaccess files
  
This week we will discuss the [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org) web server that runs on `banjo.rit.edu` and learn how to script it with .htaccess files. By adding directives to this file, we will be able to password protect web folders, create a customized error page, and turn off some undesirable default behavior of the web server.
